My first version of Gadu-Gadu protocol implementation in Ruby released.

<a href="http://gruby.rubyforge.org/">Here</a> is very very small portion of documentation ;)
You can download it form <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/Gruby">rubyforge</a>.
Or install it via rubygems:

`# gem install GRuby`

For now it support:

- login
- send / receive message
- status change
- status description

Have fun.
