Finally I moved my <a href="http://rubyforge.org/">rubyforge</a> repositories to github and gems to <a href="http://gemcutter.org/">gemcutter.org</a>:

 - <a href="http://github.com/fazibear/gruby">gruby</a>
 - <a href="http://github.com/fazibear/colorize">colorize</a>

RDoc documentation is now on <a href="http://rdoc.info/">rdoc.info</a>.

It was quite easy. But there is necessary to use jeweler ? The only thing I need is gemspec file. Build and push are made by gem. There is any thiny tool that can manage version and gemspec files ?
