In mean time I was playing with MRuby. Embeded it into a VST and describe in my last [post]({% post_url 2015-04-13-mruby-within-vst %}).
The results of it is an [MRubyByExample](http://fazibear.github.io/mrubybyexample/mruby_main.html). Its well documented snippets of C and ruby code used with MRuby.
You can also compile it and see it working.
Checkout [github](https://github.com/fazibear/mrubybyexample) repository and execute `rake`. Compiled, documented, executed!
